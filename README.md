# UEFA Champions League Project

## Overview
UEFA Champions League (UCL) is one of the biggest football competitions conducted by the Union of European Football Association. Started in 1955, UCL is one of the most viewed and anticipated football tournaments in the world.

### The business issue 
As a prospective sponsor interested in the football industry's point of view, how can I determine the most efficient sponsorship opportunities within the UEFA Champions League?

To answer this question, I considered several key performance indicators (KPIs) :

### Categories

#### Player Performance 
Consider the performance of teams and players in the league, as successful teams and star players often attract more attention and provide better sponsorship opportunities.

#### Stadium  
Evaluate the stadiums and venues where matches are held. Larger-capacity venues can offer more exposure and fan engagement opportunities.

#### Team Reputation 
Examine the reputation and fan following of teams within the UEFA Champions League, as well as their historical performance in the league.

#### Nationality and Demographics 
Consider the nationality and demographics of both teams and players, aligning them with your target market and brand positioning.

#### Competitive Highlight 
Analyze the competitive highlight to understand better which different categories give us more indicators for the sponsor's investment.

### 4. Conclusion And Recommendations

   #### Key Players:

We recommend Robert Lewandowski to represent our brand. After analyzing the data, we have found that he has scored the most goals 54 and 15 assists between 2016 and 2022. He has also won 2 awards as the best scorer of the season and assists player of the season for 2019-2020.

From a national perspective, we recommend Messi and Neymar to represent Latin America, and Salah and Mane to represent Africa. These players have been found to lead the scoring list and assists.

#### Stadiums:

We recommend using Allianz Arena and Etihad Stadium to promote our brand, as we have observed that the most goals are scored in these stadiums. Additionally, we have found that the home teams in these stadiums, namely Bayern Munich and Manchester City, have the highest chances of winning. From a strategic perspective, we have noticed that fans are in a positive mood to celebrate, which correlates with increased purchases.

Furthermore, Camp Nou has the largest capacity among all the stadiums and a high percentage of attendance. Therefore, we recommend considering this stadium as well.

#### Team Reputation:

We observed that the teams with the highest scoring records between 2016 and 2022 are Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, and Manchester City. We recommend collaborating with these teams to feature the brand's logo on their shirts.

#### Highlights

After analyzing the timing of goal-scoring during matches, we have found that the optimal time to promote our brand is during the second half of the game. Additionally, we observed that the majority of goals are scored between the 80th and 90th minutes. This indicates that the highest level of exposure to viewers occurs in the second half, particularly during the 80th to 90th-minute period, allowing us to expand our brand exposure effectively.

#### Nationality

We can observe that the data for 2016 and 2022 shows the highest number of German players, and additionally, German teams have scored the most goals in the UEFA Champions League. As a result, we recommend that German brands consider advertising during UEFA Champions League games.

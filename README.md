# UEFA_Champions_League_Project

## Overview
UEFA Champions League (UCL) is one of the biggest football competition conducted by Union of European Football Association. Started in 1955, UCL is one of most viewed and anticipated football tournaments in the world.

### The business issue 
As a prospective sponsor interested in the football industry point view, how can I determine the most efficient sponsorship opportunities within the UEFA Champions League

To answer this question, I was consider several key performance indicators (KPIs) :

### KPI's

#### Team and Player Performance 
Consider the performance of teams and players in the league, as successful teams and star players often attract more attention and provide better sponsorship opportunities.

#### Stadium  
Evaluate the stadiums and venues where matches are held. Larger-capacity venues can offer more exposure and fan engagement opportunities.

#### Team Reputation 
Examine the reputation and fan following of teams within the UEFA Champions League, as well as their historical performance in the league.

#### Nationality and Demographics 
Consider the nationality and demographics of both teams and players, aligning them with your target market and brand positioning.

#### Competitive Highlight 
Analyze the competitive highlight to understand better in which different categories give us more indicators for sponsors investment.
